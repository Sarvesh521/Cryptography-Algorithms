# Number Theory Algorithms

Welcome to our **Number Theory Algorithms** GitHub repository. This project is a collaborative effort by **Sarvesh**, **Owais**, **Samyak**, and **Dhruv**. We are implementing various algorithms from **Victor Shoup’s book**: *"A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra"*. This work is being done as part of our **Reading Elective Course**, building on concepts we studied in a previous **Number Theory course** last semester.

## About the Project
This project is an extension of the number theory course we completed earlier, where we studied foundational algorithms such as:

- **Euclid's GCD Algorithm**
- **Extended Euclid's GCD**
- **Miller-Rabin Primality Testing**
- **Chinese Remainder Theorem**
- **Thue's Lemma**
- **Fermat's Little Theorem**
- **Euler's Phi Function**
- **Discrete Logarithms**

In this reading elective, we are diving deeper into more advanced number theory topics and implementing key algorithms from Shoup’s book. Our goal is to strengthen our theoretical understanding while gaining practical coding experience by translating these mathematical concepts into working code.

## Algorithms Implemented
So far in this course, we have worked on and implemented the following algorithms:

1. **Prime Factorization in Zn*** (Prime factorization given the multiple of exponents in a finite field)
2. **Baby Step-Giant Step Method** (Efficient algorithm for solving discrete logarithm problems)
3. **Chebyshev's Theorem** (Regarding the distribution of prime numbers)

## How to Use
You can clone the repository and run the algorithms locally. Make sure you have Python installed, along with any required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/number-theory-algorithms.git
cd number-theory-algorithms
```

## Future Plans
We are continually working on more advanced algorithms and will keep adding them as we progress. Some of the upcoming topics we plan to implement include:

- **Quadratic Residues**
- **Elliptic Curve Cryptography Basics**
- **Advanced Primality Testing Algorithms**

## Acknowledgments
We would like to thank **Victor Shoup** for his insightful book, which has been an invaluable resource in guiding us through this elective. Additionally, we extend our gratitude to the open-source community and everyone who engages with our project.

Thank you for visiting our repository!
